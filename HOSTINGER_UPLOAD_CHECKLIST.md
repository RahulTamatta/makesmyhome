# 🚀 Hostinger Upload Checklist - Fix White Screen

## ✅ Files Ready for Upload

Your Flutter web app has been built successfully! Upload these files from `build/web/` to your Hostinger `public_html/` folder:

### 📁 Required Files (Upload ALL of these):

```
public_html/
├── index.html ✅ (Enhanced with loading screen & error handling)
├── main.dart.js ✅ (6+ MB - MOST CRITICAL FILE)
├── flutter_bootstrap.js ✅
├── flutter_service_worker.js ✅
├── manifest.json ✅
├── favicon.png ✅
├── .htaccess ✅ (Handles SPA routing)
├── assets/ ✅ (Entire folder with contents)
├── icons/ ✅ (Entire folder with contents)
└── canvaskit/ ✅ (If present)
```

## 🔧 Upload Steps:

### 1. Access Hostinger File Manager
- Login to Hostinger cPanel
- Open File Manager
- Navigate to `public_html/`

### 2. Clear Existing Files (if any)
- Delete old Flutter files in `public_html/`
- Keep other files like `.well-known/`, `cgi-bin/` etc.

### 3. Upload New Files
- **Method 1**: Zip `build/web/` contents and extract in `public_html/`
- **Method 2**: Upload files individually (ensure `main.dart.js` uploads completely)

### 4. Set Permissions
- Files: `644`
- Folders: `755`

### 5. Verify Upload
Check these URLs work:
- ✅ `https://makesmyhome.com/main.dart.js` (should download/show file)
- ✅ `https://makesmyhome.com/flutter_bootstrap.js` (should download/show file)
- ✅ `https://makesmyhome.com/manifest.json` (should show JSON)

## 🎯 What's Fixed:

### ✅ Enhanced index.html:
- **Loading screen** with spinner (no more blank white screen)
- **Error handling** with helpful messages
- **Timeout detection** (shows error if app doesn't load in 15 seconds)
- **Proper Flutter bootstrap integration**

### ✅ Improved .htaccess:
- **SPA routing** (handles page refreshes)
- **GZIP compression** (faster loading)
- **Cache headers** (better performance)

### ✅ Build optimizations:
- **Correct base href** (`/` for root domain)
- **Tree-shaken icons** (smaller file sizes)
- **Optimized assets**

## 🐛 If Still White Screen After Upload:

### 1. Check Browser Console:
- Press `F12` → Console tab
- Look for red errors
- Common issues:
  - `404 main.dart.js` → File didn't upload properly
  - `CORS errors` → API connectivity issues
  - `Service worker errors` → Clear browser cache

### 2. Clear Browser Cache:
- **Hard refresh**: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
- **Or**: DevTools → Application → Storage → Clear site data

### 3. Use Debug Tool:
- Upload `debug.html` to `public_html/`
- Visit `https://makesmyhome.com/debug.html`
- Shows exactly what files are missing

### 4. Check File Sizes:
- `main.dart.js` should be 6+ MB
- If smaller, it didn't upload completely

## 🎉 Expected Result:

After upload, `https://makesmyhome.com` should show:
1. **Loading spinner** with "Loading MakesMyHome..."
2. **Your Flutter app** loads and replaces the spinner
3. **No more white screen!**

## 📞 Support:

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console errors
2. Verify all files uploaded to `public_html/` (not a subfolder)
3. Ensure `main.dart.js` is the full 6+ MB file
4. Clear browser cache completely

**The white screen issue should be completely resolved after this upload!** 🎯
